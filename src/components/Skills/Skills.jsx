              functioning and better teams dynamics.

              Problem solving is the source of all new inventions, social and
              cultural evolution.
              <br />
              It is the basis for continuous improvement, communication and
              learning.

              solve problems, and meet challenges.
              <br />
              It brings a fresh, and sometimes unorthodox, perspective to my
              work.
              <br /> This way of thinking sometimes coupled with collabrations
              with other teams in mind can help departments and organizations
              be more productive.
            </p>
