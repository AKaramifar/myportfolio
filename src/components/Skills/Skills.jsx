            <strong>HONESTY: </strong>
            <p>
              HONESTY, loyalty, integrity, uprightness, a complete refusal to
              use any underhanded method to help win business or gain any kind
              of advantage. Neither growth, nor profit nor independence have any
              real worth unless they are won through complete honesty and
              probity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>COLLABORATE: </strong>
            <p>
              Collaboration skills enable you to successfully work toward a
              common goal with others. They include communicating clearly,
              actively listening to others, taking responsibility for mistakes,
              and respecting the diversity of your colleagues
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>COMMUNICATE: </strong>
            <p>
              Effective, honest communication can bind employees together. If
              the staff are talking with each other on the job, that's a major
              step towards building a good team. Employees who look forward to
              talking with their colleagues are more enthused about coming to
              work
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>PROBLEM SOLVING:</strong>
            <p>
              Problem solving is at the core of human evolution.
              <br />
              Problem solving is the source of all new inventions, social and
              cultural evolution, and the basis for market based economies. It
              is the basis for continuous improvement, communication and
              learning
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>CREATIVE THINKING: </strong>
            <p>
              Creative thinking might mean devising new ways to carry out tasks,
              solve problems, and meet challenges. It means bringing a fresh,
              and sometimes unorthodox, perspective to your work. This way of
              thinking can help departments and organizations be more productive
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>FUNNY: </strong>
            <p>
              FUN, means feeling good about being part of the company or oneâ€™s
              team, feeling proud of what one does, feeling a sense of
              accomplishment in the search for better quality and greater
              efficiency, feeling part of a challenging project
            </p>
